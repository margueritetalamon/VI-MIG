# Variational Inference with Gaussian Mixture

There are two types of optimization in the optim.py' file :
- Optimization on the mean of each gaussian of the mixture
- Optimization on the mean AND variance of the each gaussian of the mixture.

We further consider that the variance covariance matrix of each gaussian is written as $\epsilon_i I$
